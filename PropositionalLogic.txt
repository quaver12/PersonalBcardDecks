h:What are the names of the following rules of inference

q:P->Q     P     Therefore Q
a:Modus Ponens
 - Modus Ponens is Positive - think Ponens Positive - it 'affirms'. E.g. If it's raining then it's cloudy. It is raining, therefore it is cloudy.
q:P->Q     ~Q    Therefore ~P
a:Modus Tollens
 - Modus tollens 'denies'. E.g. If it's raining it's cloudy. It is not cloudy, therefore it's not raining.
q:P     Therefore PvQ
a:Addition
 - Also called 'Disjunction Introduction'. E.g. It's raining. Therefore the statement 'it's raining or it's cloudy' would be true.
q:P^Q     Therefore P
a:Simplification
 - Also called 'Conjunction Elimination'. E.g. It's raining and it's cloudy, therefore it is in fact raining.
q:P->Q    Q->R     Therefore, P->R
a:Hypothetical Syllogism
 - Effectively the 'transitivity' of implications. E.g. If it's raining, then it's cloudy. If it's cloudy, then I'll be sad. Therfore, if it's raining then I'll be sad. 
q:PvQ     ~P     Therefore Q
a:Disjunctive Syllogism
 - E.g. If i choose soup or salad. I don't choose soup. Therefore I must have chosen Salad.
q:P->Q    Therefore P->(P^Q)
a:Absorption
 - E.g. If it will rain, then I'll change my coat.  Therefore, if it will rain, it will rain and I'll change my coat.

h:What are the names of the following replacement rules suggested by the expressions?

q:QvP=PvQ  &   Q^P=P^Q
a:Commutative Law
 - The order of Prepostions doesn't matter - doesn't affect conjunction or disjunction
q:(PvQ)vR = Pv(QvR)
a:Associative Law
 - Grouping doesn't matter for continuous disjunction and conjunction
q:P^(QvR) = (P^Q)v(P^R)    &     Pv(Q^R)=(PvQ)^(PvR)
a:Distributive Law
 - 
q:~P^~Q = ~(PvQ)
a:De Morgan's Law
 - The conjunction of negations = the negation of disjunction
q:Pv(P^Q) just = P
a:Absorption
 - 
q:P^T=T   &   PvF=F
a:Identity
 - (T is a tautology and F a contradiction)
q:PvP=P      and      P^P=P
a:Idempotence
 - conjunction and disjunction can be done any number of times on the same proposition and not change it.
q:Pv~P=T    and    P^~P=F
a:Negation
 - (T is a tautology and F a contradiction)
q:~(~P)
a:Double negation
 - 	
q:P->Q can be expressed as ~PvQ
a:Implication
 - 
q:P->Q can be expressed as ~Q->~P
a:Contraposition
 - 	
q: P<->Q is logically equivalent to (Q->P)^(Q->P)
a:Equivalence
 -
