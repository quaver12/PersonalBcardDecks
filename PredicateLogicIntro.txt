h:Predicate Logic Intro:

q:Predicate logic is broken into two parts: Syntax and what?
a:Semantics
    -   Semantics assigns meanings to symbols using models
q:True or false: everything true for propositional logic is also true for predicate logic?
a:True
 - All rules from propositional logic carry over to predicate logic! This does not mean everything for predicate logic carries over to propositional however.





h:Predicate Logic Syntax

q:A formula is made up of what two components?
a:Terms and Predicates
Terms are 'nouns' or objects, and predicates are the 'verbs' that describe their properties or relations between terms.

q:Terms are notated with a capital letter: True or False?
a:False
    -   Terms are objects and subjects and are notated with lower case letters. E.g. Aristotle = a
q:There can be up to two predicates in a formula.
a:False
    -   Predicates are 'verbs' - relations or propeties between objecs, and there can only be one per formula.
q:What is the subject in the following sentence: Johnny bought his jeans from Vinted.
a:Johnny
    -
q:What are the two types of predicates?
a:Properties and Relations
    -
q:What is the Arity of the following Formula? (enter as a nummber) M(s,a)
a:2
    - Arity is the number or terms taken as the argument: this example has s & a so it is 2.



h:Compound Formulae

q: Compound Formulae are formed of, atomic formulae, logical connectives, and what?
a: Quantifiers
    - The quantifiers: Existential (backwards E) and Universal (Upside down A).
